# Learning C++ via Multi-layer Perceptorn Neural Network Implementation

MLP neural network architecture implemented from scratch in C++ for learning purposes.
)
- Custom implementation without external ML libraries
- Features:
  - Flexible network topology with configurable layer sizes
  - Multiple activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax)
  - Advanced optimisers (SGD, SGD+Momentum, NAG, Adam, AdamW)
  - Cross-entropy and MSE loss functions
  - Multi-threaded training for improved performance
  - Model serialisation (save/load functionality)
  - Training metrics logging and visualisation
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)

## Learning Outcomes
- See `learnings.md` for detailed C++ insights gained during implementation.
- Understanding of NN architectures, how they work, and how to train them.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Standard Template Library (STL)
